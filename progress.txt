## Codebase Patterns
- The project uses a `project.json` file to track phases with statuses: pending/planned/executing/complete
- CLI commands are routed through `src/cli.ts` with auto-detect mode based on file presence (prd.json → ralph mode, project.json → full mode)
- Status display uses UTF-8 icons for visual feedback: ✓ (complete), ▶ (executing), ○ (planned), · (pending)
- Always use `showStatus(projectPath)` to display formatted project progress from project.json

## 2026-02-03T17:30:00.000Z - SE-01, SE-02, SE-03, SE-04
- Implemented complete session management status functionality
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/state/status.ts (showStatus function)
  - Modified: src/cli.ts (wired status command, fixed auto-detect mode)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The status display logic determines "CURRENT" phase intelligently: executing phase, or first pending phase after last complete phase
  - Auto-detect mode in cli.ts checks for prd.json first (ralph mode), then project.json (full mode)
  - The status command provides suggested next actions based on phase status: pending → plan, planned → execute, executing → verify
  - TypeScript checks with `bunx tsc --noEmit` must pass before committing
  - Status output format uses 60-character separator lines for clean terminal display
